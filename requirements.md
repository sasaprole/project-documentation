- Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure data processing reliability

### 1.3 API Contracts and Service Interfaces
- Design a set of RESTful APIs to expose the core business functionality to client applications
- Ensure API contracts are well-documented, versioned, and follow industry best practices (e.g., OpenAPI Specification)
- Implement API gateways or API management solutions to provide a unified entry point for client applications

### 1.4 Authentication and Authorization
- Implement a centralized authentication and authorization mechanism, leveraging industry-standard protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect)
- Support multiple authentication methods, including username/password, social logins, and single sign-on
- Enforce fine-grained authorization controls based on user roles and permissions

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Performance Benchmarks and Scalability Targets
- Establish performance benchmarks for key user scenarios, including response times, throughput, and concurrent user capacity
- Design the system to be horizontally scalable, with the ability to add more compute resources (e.g., servers, containers) to handle increased load
- Implement caching strategies and optimized data access patterns to improve performance

### 2.2 Database Design and Data Access Patterns
- Evaluate the use of a relational database (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL) for transactional data storage and a NoSQL database (e.g., CosmosDB, MongoDB) for non-relational data
- Implement efficient data access patterns, such as repository patterns and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Ensure the data access layer is decoupled from the domain model and business logic

### 2.3 Caching Strategies and Optimization
- Implement an in-memory caching solution (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data
- Develop cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency and freshness
- Optimize database queries and data access patterns to minimize the need for caching

### 2.4 Monitoring, Logging, and Observability
- Implement a centralized logging solution to capture application logs, errors, and performance metrics
- Integrate with a monitoring and observability platform (e.g., Application Insights, New Relic) to provide real-time visibility into system health and performance
- Ensure logging and monitoring are configured to capture relevant information for troubleshooting and root cause analysis

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 .NET Version and Framework Requirements
- Target .NET 6 or the latest long-term supported (LTS) version of the .NET framework
- Leverage the latest features and improvements in the .NET ecosystem, including ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and modern C# language features

### 3.2 Microservices vs. Monolithic Considerations
- Adopt a microservices architecture where appropriate, with each service responsible for a specific domain or business capability
- Evaluate the trade-offs between a monolithic architecture and a microservices architecture, considering factors such as complexity, scalability, and deployment flexibility

### 3.3 Database Technology Selection
- Evaluate the use of a relational database (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL) for transactional data storage
- Consider a NoSQL database (e.g., CosmosDB, MongoDB) for non-relational data and high-scale scenarios
- Ensure the database selection aligns with the performance, scalability, and data access requirements of the application

### 3.4 Message Queuing and Async Processing
- Implement asynchronous message queuing and processing to decouple components and improve overall system resilience
- Evaluate message queue technologies (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus) to handle high-volume data processing and integration with external systems

### 3.5 Docker Containerization
- Package the application and all its dependencies into Docker containers to ensure consistent deployment and environmental parity across different environments
- Leverage container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Azure Container Instances) to manage the deployment and scaling of the containerized application

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 C# Coding Standards and Best Practices
- Establish and enforce a consistent set of C# coding standards, including naming conventions, code formatting, and design patterns
- Adopt modern C# language features and idioms, such as async/await, LINQ, and pattern matching
- Ensure the codebase adheres to principles of clean code, maintainability, and testability

### 4.2 Error Handling and Logging
- Implement a centralized error handling and logging strategy, with consistent exception management and logging across the application
- Ensure logging provides sufficient context and detail to enable effective troubleshooting and root cause analysis

### 4.3 Unit Testing and Integration Testing
- Establish a comprehensive unit testing framework to validate the correctness of individual components and modules
- Implement integration tests to verify the end-to-end functionality of the system, including cross-service interactions and data processing pipelines
- Ensure the test suite provides sufficient coverage and is integrated into the continuous integration (CI) pipeline

### 4.4 CI/CD Pipeline
- Establish a fully automated continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to manage the build, test, and deployment of the application
- Leverage tools and technologies (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions) to automate the CI/CD process and ensure consistent, reliable, and repeatable deployments

## 5. Success Criteria

### 5.1 Performance Metrics and SLAs
- Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and service-level agreements (SLAs) for the system, including response times, throughput, and concurrent user capacity
- Continuously monitor and report on the system's performance to ensure it meets the established SLAs

### 5.2 Code Quality Metrics
- Implement code quality checks, such as static code analysis, code coverage, and technical debt monitoring, to ensure the codebase maintains a high level of quality and maintainability
- Establish clear quality thresholds and integrate these checks into the CI/CD pipeline

### 5.3 Test Coverage Requirements
- Ensure the test suite provides a minimum of 80% code coverage for critical business functionality and core components
